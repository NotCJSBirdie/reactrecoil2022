#REACTRECOIL2022

Welcome to React Recoil 2022!

This project contains Next.js (obviously), TailwindCSS, TypeScript and Jest.

This project mainly highlights the newly released react state management library (RECOIL).

I have been using Redux for years but I was surprised that Facebook themselves did the job by releasing their own version of a state management library.

This project is still in the works. Please watch for future updates and pull requests and issues.
